HITL/HOTL Module - Human-in-the-Loop and Human-on-the-Loop Framework

This module provides a comprehensive framework for human-AI collaboration in
security operations, ensuring that critical decisions receive appropriate human
oversight while maintaining operational efficiency.

Key Features:
- Risk-based automation level determination (FULL, SUPERVISED, ADVISORY, MANUAL)
- Decision queue with SLA tracking
- Escalation management for timeouts and high-risk scenarios
- Operator interface for human review and approval
- Complete audit trail for compliance and forensics

Architecture:
    MAXIMUS AI Decision
            ↓
    Risk Assessor → Automation Level
            ↓
    HIGH (≥95%)? → EXECUTE (auto)
    MEDIUM (≥80%)? → SUPERVISED (approval required)
    LOW (≥60%)? → ADVISORY (AI suggests, human decides)
    VERY LOW (<60%)? → MANUAL (no AI execution)
            ↓
    Decision Queue (SLA: 5-30min)
            ↓
    Operator Interface
            ↓
    Execute + Audit Trail

Privacy & Security:
- All decisions logged with complete context
- Audit trail immutable and timestamped
- Role-based access control for operators
- PII redaction in logs (configurable)

Integration:
- Integrates with MAXIMUS AI reasoning engine
- Works with Immunis immune system for threat response
- Feeds ethical_audit_service for compliance tracking

Usage:
    from hitl import (
        HITLDecisionFramework,
        RiskAssessor,
        DecisionQueue,
        OperatorInterface,
        AuditTrail,
    )

    # Initialize framework
    framework = HITLDecisionFramework(config)

    # AI makes decision
    decision = framework.evaluate_action(
        action_type="isolate_host",
        context={"host_id": "srv-123", "threat_score": 0.92},
        confidence=0.88,
    )

    # Check automation level
    if decision.automation_level == AutomationLevel.FULL:
        # Execute immediately
        result = framework.execute_decision(decision)
    else:
        # Queue for human review
        framework.queue_for_review(decision)
