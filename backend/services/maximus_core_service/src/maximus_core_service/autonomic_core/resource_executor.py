"""Maximus Core Service - Resource Executor.

This module is responsible for executing resource allocation plans generated by
the Resource Planner. It interacts with underlying system APIs (e.g., Docker SDK,
Kubernetes API, OS-level controls) to make real-time adjustments to the AI's
operational environment.

This component ensures that the decisions made by the Homeostatic Control Loop
(HCL) are translated into concrete actions, maintaining system stability and
performance.
