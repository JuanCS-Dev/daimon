"""Maximus Core Service - Resource Analyzer.

This module provides real-time statistical analysis of system metrics to detect
anomalies, identify trends, and predict future resource needs. It uses robust
statistical methods to ensure accurate and actionable insights into the AI's
operational health and performance.

This component is crucial for the Homeostatic Control Loop (HCL) to make
informed decisions about resource allocation and system adjustments.
