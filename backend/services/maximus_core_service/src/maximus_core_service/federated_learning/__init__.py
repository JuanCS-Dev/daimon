Federated Learning Module for VÉRTICE Platform

This module provides federated learning capabilities for collaborative
threat intelligence model training across multiple organizations without
sharing raw data.

Key Components:
- FLCoordinator: Central server for aggregating model updates
- FLClient: On-premise client for local training
- FedAvgAggregator: Federated averaging aggregation
- SecureAggregator: Secure aggregation with secret sharing
- ModelAdapters: Adapters for VÉRTICE ML models

Features:
✅ Privacy-preserving collaborative training
✅ Secure aggregation protocol
✅ Differential privacy support
✅ TLS-encrypted communication
✅ Model versioning and round history
✅ Performance monitoring and metrics
✅ Production-ready implementation

Privacy Guarantees:
- Raw data never leaves client premises
- Only model updates (gradients/weights) are shared
- Optional: Secure aggregation (server sees only aggregate)
- Optional: Differential privacy on updates (ε=8.0, δ=1e-5)

Performance:
- FL round latency: <30 min (3-5 clients)
- Model accuracy vs centralized: ≥95%
- Communication overhead: <200MB per client per round

Use Cases:
1. Threat classifier training (narrative_manipulation_filter)
2. Malware detector training (immunis_macrophage_service)
3. Multi-organization threat intelligence sharing
