"""Attention System - Foveal/Peripheral Vision-Inspired Resource Allocation

Bio-inspired two-tier processing system that efficiently allocates analytical
resources by combining:
- Peripheral monitoring: Fast, lightweight scanning of all inputs
- Foveal analysis: Deep, expensive analysis of high-salience targets

This mimics human visual attention, where peripheral vision detects movement
and changes, triggering foveal (central) vision to focus on important details.

Key Components:
- AttentionSystem: Main coordinator of attention-driven monitoring
- PeripheralMonitor: Lightweight statistical scanning (<100ms)
- FovealAnalyzer: Deep threat analysis for high-salience targets
- SalienceScorer: Calculates attention priority scores
