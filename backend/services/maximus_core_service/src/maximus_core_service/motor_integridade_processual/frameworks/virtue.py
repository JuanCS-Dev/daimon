"""
Virtue Ethics Framework.

Implements Aristotelian virtue ethics focusing on character and eudaimonia (flourishing).
Evaluates actions based on whether they exemplify virtuous character traits.

Core Principles:
- Virtue lies in the Golden Mean (balance between extremes)
- Eudaimonia (human flourishing) is the ultimate goal
- Character matters more than isolated acts

Based on Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics.
