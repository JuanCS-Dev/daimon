"""Fairness & Bias Mitigation Module for VÉRTICE Platform.

This module provides comprehensive fairness monitoring and bias mitigation for
cybersecurity AI models, ensuring equitable treatment across different groups.

Key Components:
    - FairnessConstraints: Demographic parity, equalized odds, calibration
    - BiasDetector: Statistical tests, disparate impact analysis
    - MitigationEngine: Reweighing, adversarial debiasing, threshold optimization
    - FairnessMonitor: Continuous monitoring and alerting

Protected Attributes:
    - Geographic location (country/region)
    - Organization size (SMB vs Enterprise)
    - Industry vertical

Target Metrics:
    - Fairness violations: <1%
    - Bias detection accuracy: >95%
    - False positive rate: <5%
