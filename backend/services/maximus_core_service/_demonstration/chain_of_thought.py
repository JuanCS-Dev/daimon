"""Maximus Core Service - Chain of Thought Module.

This module implements the Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning process for the
Maximus AI. CoT enables Maximus to break down complex problems into intermediate
steps, articulate its reasoning process, and generate more transparent and
structured responses.

By explicitly generating a sequence of thoughts, Maximus can improve its ability
to tackle multi-step reasoning tasks, enhance explainability, and facilitate
debugging and refinement of its cognitive processes.
