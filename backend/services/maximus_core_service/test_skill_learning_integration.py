Skill Learning - MAXIMUS Integration Tests

Validates that Skill Learning System is properly integrated with MaximusIntegrated.
Tests integration without requiring HSAS service (structure validation).

Tests:
1. MaximusIntegrated initializes with Skill Learning support
2. Skill Learning availability flag works correctly
3. execute_learned_skill() handles unavailable gracefully
4. learn_skill_from_demonstration() connects with memory
5. compose_skill_from_primitives() connects with neuromodulation
6. get_skill_learning_state() returns correct structure
7. System status includes Skill Learning
