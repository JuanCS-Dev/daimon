"""Performance Benchmarks - Consciousness System

Benchmarks measure performance metrics against biological plausibility targets.

Target Metrics (from FASE IV roadmap):
- ESGT ignition latency: <100ms P99
- MMEI → MCEA pipeline: <50ms
- Immune response time: <200ms
- Arousal modulation: <20ms
- End-to-end consciousness cycle: <500ms

Success Criteria: All metrics within biological plausibility

Authors: Juan & Claude Code
Version: 1.0.0 - FASE IV Sprint 3
