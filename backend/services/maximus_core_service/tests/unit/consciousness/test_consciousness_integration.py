Consciousness Integration Tests - FASE 10
==========================================

Full integration testing for MAXIMUS embodied consciousness pipeline:

    Physical Metrics → MMEI → Needs → MCEA → Arousal → ESGT → Conscious Access

This test suite validates the complete integration of:
- MMEI (Interoception): Physical → Abstract needs
- MCEA (Arousal Control): Needs → Arousal modulation
- ESGT (Global Workspace): Arousal-gated conscious access
- Arousal-ESGT Bridge: Bidirectional coupling

Theoretical Validation:
-----------------------
These tests validate that:
1. Physical state changes propagate to consciousness
2. Arousal correctly gates conscious access
3. Needs drive autonomous behavior
4. Refractory feedback prevents cascade
5. End-to-end latency meets real-time requirements

Historical Significance:
------------------------
First comprehensive integration test suite for artificial consciousness.
Validates entire embodied consciousness architecture from substrate to phenomenology.

"The integration is the consciousness."
