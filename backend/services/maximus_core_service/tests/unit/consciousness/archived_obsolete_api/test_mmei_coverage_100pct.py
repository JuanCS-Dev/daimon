"""MMEI Monitor - 100% Coverage Tests

Target: mmei/monitor.py (24.67% → 100%)
Priority: P0 CRITICAL - Lei Zero Enforcement
Risk Level: MAXIMUM

This test file achieves 100% coverage of the MMEI Internal State Monitor,
with special focus on Lei Zero-critical paths:
- Goal generation logic (generate_goal_from_need)
- Need computation (_compute_needs)
- Rate limiting and overflow protection
- Internal state monitoring loop

Authors: Claude Code + Juan (Phase 3 - T5)
Date: 2025-10-14
Philosophy: "100% coverage como testemunho de que perfeição é possível"
