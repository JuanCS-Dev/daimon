Integration Circuit Breaker Tests
==================================

Tests circuit breaker patterns for consciousness component integration.

Theoretical Foundation:
-----------------------
Circuit breakers prevent cascading failures in distributed systems by:
1. **Fast failure**: Stop calling failed services immediately
2. **Recovery**: Allow services time to recover
3. **State management**: Open/half-open/closed transitions
4. **Health checks**: Validate recovery before full reconnection

Consciousness Implications:
---------------------------
**Biology**: Neural circuits have protection mechanisms (refractory periods,
inhibition) that prevent runaway excitation.

**Engineering**: Distributed consciousness components must protect each other
from cascading failures.

**States**:
- **CLOSED**: Normal operation, requests pass through
- **OPEN**: Failure threshold exceeded, requests fail fast
- **HALF_OPEN**: Testing recovery, limited requests pass

"Fail fast, recover gracefully, prevent cascades."
