"""Maximus HCL Planner Service - Main Application Entry Point.

This module serves as the main entry point for the Maximus Homeostatic Control
Loop (HCL) Planner Service. It initializes and configures the FastAPI
application, sets up event handlers for startup and shutdown, and defines the
API endpoints for receiving analysis results and generating resource alignment plans.

It orchestrates the application of planning algorithms, such as fuzzy logic
controllers or reinforcement learning agents, to develop optimal strategies for
resource allocation, scaling, and configuration changes. This service is crucial
for translating HCL analysis into actionable plans for the HCL Executor Service,
ensuring Maximus AI's adaptive self-management.
