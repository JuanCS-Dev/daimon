"""Maximus Prefrontal Cortex Service - Rational Decision Validator.

This module implements a Rational Decision Validator for the Maximus AI's
Prefrontal Cortex Service. It is responsible for critically evaluating potential
decisions or plans to ensure their logical coherence, consistency with goals,
and adherence to ethical guidelines.

Key functionalities include:
- Assessing the logical soundness of a decision's rationale.
- Checking for conflicts with established long-term goals or values.
- Identifying potential unintended consequences or ethical dilemmas.
- Providing a confidence score or a detailed critique of a proposed decision.

This validator is crucial for ensuring that Maximus AI's actions are not only
effective but also rational, ethical, and aligned with its overarching objectives,
preventing flawed reasoning or unintended negative outcomes.
