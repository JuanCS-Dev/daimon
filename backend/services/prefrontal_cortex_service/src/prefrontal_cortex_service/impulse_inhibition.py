"""Maximus Prefrontal Cortex Service - Impulse Inhibition Module.

This module implements an Impulse Inhibition mechanism for the Maximus AI's
Prefrontal Cortex Service. Inspired by the biological prefrontal cortex's role
in self-control, this module is responsible for modulating the AI's tendency
to act impulsively, promoting more deliberate and rational decision-making.

Key functionalities include:
- Receiving signals from other cognitive modules indicating potential impulsive actions.
- Applying inhibitory controls to delay or suppress immediate responses.
- Balancing the need for rapid action with the benefits of careful consideration.
- Providing a mechanism for Maximus AI to override its default reactive behaviors,
  enabling it to adhere to long-term goals, ethical guidelines, and strategic plans,
  even under pressure.
