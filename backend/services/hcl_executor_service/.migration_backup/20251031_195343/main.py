"""Maximus HCL Executor Service - Main Application Entry Point.

This module serves as the main entry point for the Maximus Homeostatic Control
Loop (HCL) Executor Service. It initializes and configures the FastAPI
application, sets up event handlers for startup and shutdown, and defines the
API endpoints for receiving and executing resource alignment plans.

It orchestrates the execution of concrete actions based on plans from the HCL
Planner Service, interacting with underlying infrastructure (e.g., Kubernetes,
Docker) to adjust the AI's operational environment. This service is crucial
for translating HCL decisions into real-world system changes, maintaining
Maximus AI's stability and performance.
