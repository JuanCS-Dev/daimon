"""Maximus Digital Thalamus Service - Attention Control Module.

This module implements an attention control mechanism within the Maximus AI's
Digital Thalamus. Inspired by biological attention, this module dynamically
prioritizes and routes sensory information based on its perceived importance,
saliency, or relevance to current goals.

By selectively enhancing or suppressing the flow of sensory data, Maximus can
focus its cognitive resources on the most critical information, preventing
overload and improving the efficiency of higher-level processing. This is crucial
for maintaining responsiveness and effective decision-making in complex and
dynamic environments.
